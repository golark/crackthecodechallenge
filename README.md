# Crack the code challange
- Your task is to crack the code and find the original message in the document `secret.txt`.
- The code used a simple substitution cipher called caesar code, where each letter is replaced by another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet
- For instance, if the key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so on
- Original document contains ascii characters 32 - 127 inclusive
- link to ascii table: https://www.asciitable.com/
- The key is not given, hence your solution will need to figure out the key
- asciifrequency.txt is available for you to use should you need to
- Once you crack the code, a second challenge will appear at the bottom of the original text. You will need to crack this code as well to complete the challenge.
